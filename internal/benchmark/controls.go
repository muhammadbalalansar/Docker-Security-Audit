controls.go

CIS Docker Benchmark control registry with all Section 1-7 controls

Defines the Control struct and a global map populated at init time
across seven section registration functions. Controls are looked up
by ID from all analyzer packages and converted to finding.CISControl
via ToCISControl() for embedding in findings.

Key exports:
  Control - CIS control with ID, section, severity, remediation, and
references
  Register, Get, All, BySection - registry access
  Control.ToCISControl - converts to finding.CISControl

Connects to:
  finding.go - ToCISControl produces finding.CISControl embedded in
findings
  analyzer/container.go - fetches Section 5 controls by ID
  analyzer/daemon.go - fetches Section 2 controls by ID
  analyzer/dockerfile.go - fetches Section 4 controls by ID
  analyzer/image.go - fetches Section 4 controls by ID
  main.go - listBenchmarkControls and showBenchmarkControl CLI commands
