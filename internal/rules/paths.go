Sensitive host path and container socket definitions with severity ratings

DockerSocketPaths covers container runtime sockets (Docker, containerd,
CRI-O, Podman, CRI-dockerd, rkt). SensitiveHostPaths covers system
config, kernel interfaces, CI/CD runner dirs, cloud agent dirs,
secrets managers, databases, and more. Lookups use pre-computed hash
sets and prefix matching for consistent O(1) checks.

Key exports:
  DockerSocketPaths - map of container runtime socket paths with severity
  SensitiveHostPaths - map of sensitive host filesystem paths with
severity
  IsSensitivePath, IsDockerSocket - fast boolean checks
  GetPathInfo, GetPathSeverity - retrieve description and severity by path

Connects to:
  finding.go - uses Severity constants
  analyzer/container.go - checks container mount sources
  analyzer/compose.go - checks compose volume mount sources
